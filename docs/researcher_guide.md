# Researcher's Guide

As a researcher on this project, your role is to develop and fine-tune the summarization model, as well as establish evaluation metrics.

## Tasks

1. **Data Preparation**
   - Collect and preprocess a dataset of AI research papers.
   - Store the data in the `research/data/sample_papers/` directory.

2. **Model Development**
   - Fine-tune a pre-trained language model (e.g., T5, BART) for the summarization task.
   - Implement the model in `research/models/fine_tuned_model.py`.

3. **Evaluation Metrics**
   - Develop appropriate evaluation metrics for summarization quality.
   - Implement these metrics in `research/evaluation/metrics.py`.

4. **Experimentation**
   - Conduct experiments with different model architectures and hyperparameters.
   - Document your findings and best-performing models.

## Collaboration with Engineers

- Communicate regularly with the engineering team about model input/output formats.
- Provide guidance on model deployment and potential optimizations.
- Assist in developing test cases for the summarization functionality.
